        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Modern cars have come a long way since the early days of the
          automobile industry. Today's vehicles are equipped with advanced
          technology, superior safety features, and impressive performance
          capabilities.

        <h2>Technological Advancements</h2>
        <p>
          The automotive industry has seen significant technological
          advancements in recent years. Features such as autonomous driving,
          electric powertrains, and advanced infotainment systems are now common
          in many vehicles.
        </p>
        <h3>Autonomous Driving</h3>
        <p>
          Autonomous driving technology has progressed rapidly, with many
          manufacturers offering semi-autonomous features. These systems can
          assist with tasks such as lane-keeping, adaptive cruise control, and
          parking.
        </p>
        <h3>Electric Vehicles</h3>
        <p>
          Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular as they
          offer a sustainable alternative to traditional internal combustion
          engines. EVs produce zero emissions and are often cheaper to operate
          and maintain.
        </p>
        <h3>Infotainment Systems</h3>
        <p>
          Modern cars are equipped with sophisticated infotainment systems that
          provide drivers with navigation, entertainment, and connectivity
          options. These systems often include large touchscreens, voice
          recognition, and smartphone integration.

        <h2>Safety Features</h2>
        <p>
          Safety is a top priority for modern car manufacturers. Advanced safety
          features such as automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring,
          and adaptive headlights are now standard in many vehicles.
        </p>

        <h2>Performance and Efficiency</h2>
        <p>
          Modern cars are designed to deliver both performance and efficiency.
          Turbocharged engines, hybrid powertrains, and lightweight materials
          help achieve better fuel economy without compromising on power.
