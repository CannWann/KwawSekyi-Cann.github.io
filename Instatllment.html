        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Owning a sports car is a dream for many. With various installment
          payment plans available, this dream can become a reality. Here, we
          explore some of the popular financing options for purchasing sports
          cars.

        <h2>Traditional Auto Loans</h2>
        <p>
          Traditional auto loans are the most common way to finance a sports
          car. Banks and credit unions offer these loans with fixed or variable
          interest rates. The loan terms typically range from 36 to 72 months.

        <h2>Leasing Options</h2>
        <p>
          Leasing a sports car is another popular option. Leasing allows you to
          drive a new car for a set period, usually 2 to 4 years, with lower
          monthly payments compared to buying. At the end of the lease, you can
          either return the car or purchase it.

        <h2>Dealer Financing</h2>
        <p>
          Many sports car dealerships offer their own financing plans. These
          plans can include promotional interest rates or extended loan terms.
          Dealer financing can be a convenient option, as it often simplifies
          the buying process.

        <h2>Balloon Payment Plans</h2>
        <p>
          A balloon payment plan allows you to make lower monthly payments for
          the loan term, with a larger lump sum payment at the end. This option
          can make sports cars more affordable initially, though you need to
          plan for the final payment.
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Contract Purchase (PCP)</h2>
        <p>
          PCP is a flexible financing option that combines aspects of both
          traditional loans and leasing. You pay a deposit, followed by monthly
          payments. At the end of the term, you can choose to return the car,
          trade it in, or pay a final balloon payment to keep it.
